		<p>A fan-made, open-source recreation of the game "Taiko No Tatsujin" (太鼓の達人) for web browsers.
			In my opinion, this is the best version of the original game, thought, you can't make a account (maybe you can, but i can't).
			Don't tell Bandai Namco, thought</p>

		<p>A website for archived stuff, like games or movies.
			Really good for emulation stuff (thought you need to have a account to see the games..) and watch nostalgic stuff (or maybe not, i dunno, i just there for the games)</p>
