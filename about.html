		<p>Yan is a young (19 years old) autistic human being from a country from South America</p>
	<p>They are responsible for the website you are looking at (or maybe you just look at the code, even so...Hi!)</p>
		<p>Yan likes drawing, gaming (b̶a̶d̶l̶y̶), retro tech/gaming and those bootleg consoles and games you find on Aliexpress and similiar websites (there are fun to look at it)</p>
		<p>Using a openSUSE Tumbleweed as his OS and a Ideapad computer, Yan is responsible for this website that may or not look shit (this is intencional, btw)</p>
			<p>Yan is also one of those people that call themselves """Otakus""" (they really like j-games, like any game made by Nintendo, and j-music, like those that appear on the Taiko No Tatsujin games (really good games btw), not really into anime and food thought...)</p>
		<p>They dream is to have a Steam Deck (they are really priced on my country, both online and phsical) and playing really heavy games like, i dunno, Ape Escape 3 in 4K resolution??? (not really interest in serious games, sadly..)
			<p>Even you wanna to tip this person, you can click on the creppy money thing-y so you can tip me something! (maybe a lot of money /j)</p>
